# Travelia


## Set-up
### Requirements
Before you try to run Travelia you need to have installed: 
* [git](https://git-scm.com/) (Optional)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

### How to install the dependencies
```
> git clone https://github.com/ichirodev/travelia
> cd travelia/travelia-app
> npm install
```
### How to run Travelia
There are various two ways you can run Travelia locally, one by using the default Node method
```
> npm start
```
And the second way, using Nodemon which I recommend in development enviroments
```
> npm run dev
```
Now you should be able to use Travelia on the defined port with your prefered browser. If Travelia is running locally and the port hasn't been changed the default port should be: `localhost:3001`

Remember that mongoDB should be running all the time, even before starting the server on Node.
